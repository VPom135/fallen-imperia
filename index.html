          Across the fertile lands of Agreon, the scorched Island of Oteth, the vast Iublias Archipelago,
          and even the far eastern lands of Riotao, once ruled a mighty empire born from the heart of this 
          world, at Easlia. Once the Kingdom of Kerid, later proclamed the "Dominion of Imperia", a mighty 
          and legendary empire who had grasped all land known to it's people, until it found it's blunt end 
          in a cataclysmic disaster.

          <h2>Premise</h2>
          <p>
            The campaign explores the aftermath of the fall of the great Imperia, focusing on 
            the struggle for survival and power in a world shaped by its collapse. New political entities
            scavanged over the ruins of the old empire, each vying for control over their own territories
            and resources. While most surviving folk kept their countryside lives, or their urban occupations, 
            maintaning what once was the backbone of this society, a few unlucky souls found themselves drawn 
            to the misteries that drove this mighty piece of history to it's current state.

          <p>
            A farmer in Agreon, a merchant in the golden coast, a sailor in the Iublias, a miner in Oteth or a 
            pilgrim in Riotao — famine, pirates or bandits, drought... life is harsh, harsh enough to make you 
            wonder what happened to the world that once existed. The stories of glory, images of the wealthy capital,
            tales of emperors walking alongside dragons and deities... all seem like a mockery when compared to the 
            current state of things.
